## What is Ontopanel?

Ontopanel is a plugin in [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) that helps domain experts to build ontologies and method graph visually.

It is designed within the framework of the [Materials Open Laboratory (MatOLab)](https://github.com/Mat-O-Lab) by [Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM)](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html) to solve the problems encountered by domain experts when building ontologies graphically using diagrames.net, such as ontology reuse, ontology transformation and data mapping.

## About this

This is a demo of diagrams.net with Ontopanel plugin on the GithubPage. Ontopanel can be loaded via Extra-plugins.

**Please note! The official Diagrams.net website does not contain this plugin, only this version here.**

Visit Ontopanel-diagrams.net version: [diagrams.net with Ontopanel](https://yuechenbam.github.io/src/main/webapp/index.html)

Because this plugin version is hosted in the GithubPage, only the editor feature is available, other features related to Git or Collarbtion are not available.

This is a beta version, please consider hosting it on a dynamic server to get the full functionality of diagrams.net.

If you see the error in other browsers, please use Chrome to open it.

## Warning

Please note that this demo tool uses a backend hosted on a non-EU server and therefore your data may be processed on a non-EU server. The provision of any personal or confidential information is at the user's own risk. The personal registration is optional; non-registered users can use this tool without any limitation of funtionality.

## Tutorials

The Ontopanel plugin contains three parts (tools): Library, EntityManager, and Convertor.

### Ontopanel-Library

The library is designed for whole Ontopanel plugin. It is based on [Chowlk libary](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html), so please check their notations to understand it. It has some different features from Chowlk library:

1. Load automatically in the sidebar.
2. Each shape has hover effect and shape data. Shape data can be viewed and edited by "choose a shape, right-click, edit data"
3. All the shape contains a "Type" attribute, Class, ObjectProperty, DatatypeProperty, AnnotationProperty, DataType, DataValue and Individual contain also "IRI" attribute.
4. "Type", "IRI_XX", "Mapping_XX" are preserved words, try not to use them for other purposes in shape data.
5. It is recommended to always use shapes to create any entities, because their initial "IRI" is "Null".

### Ontopanel-EntityManager

EntityManager is a tool that allows user to upload their ontologies and export into the graph in diagrams.net. It has a built-in MSEO ontology, but users can upload their own ontologies. Registered users can also save their ontologies in the database. EntitiyManager is designed as a simplified version of Protégé. So it should display all entities and all details (annotations, sub-relations, equivalents, domains, ranges...) in a tree structure. If there is any information missing, you can contact me to fix the bug.

1. Upload ontologies.
2. Display and search entities in IRI or RDFLabel.
3. Export entities to the graph.
4. Exported entities can be displayed with its IRI or RDFLabel. Its IRI is saved in shape data.
5. User authentication and ontology storage in databank.

**Please note! Convertor first tries to identify this entity with its "IRI" in shape data, and if the "IRI" is empty, then it identifies its label (text). So if you change only the label (text) and the "IRI" in the shape data is not "Null", Convertor will use the "IRI" instead of the label you entered. So it is not recommended to create new entities by copying them and changing their labels.**

#### EntityFinder(old)

The old version, which is suitable for chowlk library. It contains most features.

### Ontopanel-Convertor

Convertor that convert current plot to owl ontology.

**Please note! Each exported entity has its "IRI" saved in the shape data. Convertor first tries to identify this entity with its "IRI", and if the "IRI" is empty, then it identifies its label (text).**

1. It can check the errors that are made in plot.
2. Transform button:If the plot was made with chowlk libary, instead of ontopanel-libary, transform is available.
3. User can download the file.
4. User can realize data-mapping.
5. All mapped entities are bordered with red color. And their mapping informtion are saved in the shape data. If you want to remove mapping, then delete this mapping information in the shape data.

## Architecture and limitations:

The entire application contains a front-end, a back-end and a database. This online service is for demo purposes only, so its performance is limited by the server.
Please consider hosting this application with [source codes](#related-repositories-and-links) on your own servers to remove the limitations.

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90606851/177772065-5fe3b728-8893-4084-9086-b1e711d642d2.png)

### Frontend

The Frontend is hosted on this GitHubPage. So only the editor feature of diagrams.net is available, other features related to Git or Collarbtion are not available.

Please consider hosting it on a dynamic server to get the full functionality of diagrams.net.

### Backend

The backend server has a 30-second request timeout limit, so the uploaded ontology size is also limited to about 2,000 entities, otherwise the server will not be able to process the data in time.

Please consider hosting it on your own server without the request timeout limit.
